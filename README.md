# Crypto Dashboard

The code in this repository is for running a React App that displays a crypto dashboards of various assets and their Reddit topics and Twitter hashtags using public API from technical-analysis-api.com. After initializing a react app with the npx create-react-app command, the files in the public and src files can be used to display the dashboard in your own browser. In the CoinInfo.js file you will need your own API key where "your_api_key_here" is displayed. 

In the future I plan to refactor this project quite a bit. I expected more information from the API endpoint that I sent requests to. To improve this project in the future I will refactor the code to hit a different endpoint that can give much more information about the assets. The purpose of this application is to give users information on whether the outlook for the selected coin will be good or bad. The information on this dashboard is NOT trading advice. Technical analysis has a limited ability to predict market movements and can often be wrong. 

# Getting Started with Create React App
